        "# Conformalized Early Stopping -- Regression\n",
        "\n",
        "- We implement the conformalized early stopping algorithm as well as the benchmark methods on the bike sharing demand dataset provided by Hadi Fanaee Tork from Capital Bikeshare and hosted by the UCI Machine Learning Repository [1]. \n",

        "**Note: the following dataset description is copied from UCI Machine Learning Repository. **\n",
        "Bike sharing systems are new generation of traditional bike rentals where whole process from membership, rental and return back has become automatic. Through these systems, user is able to easily rent a bike from a particular position and return back at another position. Currently, there are about over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world which is composed of over 500 thousands bicycles. Today, there exists great interest in these systems due to their important role in traffic, environmental and health issues. \n",
        "\n",
        "Apart from interesting real world applications of bike sharing systems, the characteristics of data being generated by these systems make them attractive for the research. Opposed to other transport services such as bus or subway, the duration of travel, departure and arrival position is explicitly recorded in these systems. This feature turns bike sharing system into a virtual sensor network that can be used for sensing mobility in the city. Hence, it is expected that most of important events in the city could be detected via monitoring these data.\n",
        "\n",
        "- We follow the data cleaning process and used the same model architecture as in the conformalized quantile regression experiments https://github.com/yromano/cqr/tree/master/datasets [2]. To be specific, we standardize the features to have zero mean and unit variance and we rescale the response by dividing it by its mean absolute value\n",
        "\n",
        "- For the benchmark methods, we randomly selected 2000 samples for training the deep neural network models, 1000 validation samples to decide the early stopped models, and additional 1000 samples for calibration. For the conformalized early stopping method, we use the same subset of selected samples but merge the training and validation samples and use the merged dataset for training. The 1000 calibration samples are used together with new test point to select the best models. For both benchmark and our proposed method, we train the model for  ùëámax=200  epochs, saving every snapshot, and compute the marginal coverage rate and size of the prediction intervals averaged over 100 test samples.\n",
