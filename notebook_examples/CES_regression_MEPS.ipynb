        "\n",
        "- We implement the conformalized early stopping algorithm as well as the benchmark methods on the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey data (MEPS) collected from the year 2021. The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) data consists of large scale surveys of families, individuals, and medical providers and collects data on cost and usage of medical services and demographics. \n",
        "\n",
        "- We follow the data cleaning process and used the same model architecture as in the conformalized quantile regression experiments https://github.com/yromano/cqr/tree/master/get_meps_data and download the dataset from https://github.com/IBM/AIF360. \n",
        "\n",
        "- For the benchmark methods, we randomly selected 2000 samples for training the deep neural network models, 1000 validation samples to decide the early stopped models, and additional 1000 samples for calibration. For the conformalized early stopping method, we use the same subset of selected samples but merge the training and validation samples and use the merged dataset for training. The 1000 calibration samples are used together with new test point to select the best models. For both benchmark and our proposed method, we train the model for  𝑇max=200  epochs, saving every snapshot, and compute the marginal coverage rate and size of the prediction intervals averaged over 100 test samples."
